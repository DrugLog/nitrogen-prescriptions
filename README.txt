This program creates a fertilizer prescription map for farmers. First it takes
information about a farmer's field, such as nitrogen rates available, protein,
yield, and direction in which the field is treated. After dividing the field into
subplots, the program processes data about these subplots in order to create
a map telling a farmer where to apply amounts of nitrogen. After the map is generated,
a farmer can choose to edit tiles of the map if they don't like parts of the
prescription.
